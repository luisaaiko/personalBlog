        <h1>Contact Manager</h1>

        <p>Contact Manager was a small group project in my Processes of Object Oriented Programming class. We had to implement users, and in the website we had to create a contact manager where you are able to add, delete, search and modify contacts.</p>
        <p>Since it was my second time making a website, I was little more familiar with the way it worked but the technologies were still new
            since we had to use a LAMP  stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP)</p>

        <a class="btn" href="#" role="button">Contact Manager GitHub</a>

        <p>I mostly worked on the frontend and this time I was more organized, making separate CSS and JavaScript files, but still not perfect.</p>
        <p>It was also my first time using a database in a website.</p>
