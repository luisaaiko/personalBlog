    <p>Voyage-arrr is a pirate themed, travel planning tool that utilizes AI to make a personalized travel itineraries. It was made during the 2024 UCF hackathon, and was my first time trying to build a full-stack application
        and coding in a group setting.
    </p>
    <p>The most challenging part was learning to collaborate using GitHub and understanding how the frontend and backend connect,
         along with API integration and data handeling. </p>

    <p>I mostly worked on the frontend, but was able to help a bit in the backend as well.</p>
