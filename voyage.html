    <p>Voyage-arrr is a pirate-themed travel planning tool that uses AI to create personalized itineraries. It was developed during the 2024 UCF Hackathon and marked my first experience building a full-stack application and collaborating in a group coding environment.
        One of the biggest challenges was learning to work with GitHub, understanding how the frontend and backend interact, and integrating APIs while managing data effectively. I primarily contributed to the frontend but also assisted with some backend tasks.</p>

    <p>This project was a significant learning experience for my team and me, as it was our first time developing a full-stack application. Our code is quite messy, as we were figuring things out along the way, but in the end, everything came together, and we were incredibly proud of what we built.</p>
